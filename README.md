# CBS Middleware Technical Assessment

# Coding Challenge

Design and develop a mocked RESTful API that simulates a simple payment gateway middleware, facilitating transactions between a mock retail application and a banking service.

Requirements:
Implement endpoints for initiating a transaction, checking transaction status, and receiving webhook notifications for transaction updates.

Use an in-memory database or mock data to simulate transaction records and banking service responses.

Incorporate basic authentication to secure the API endpoints.

Document the API endpoints using an open specification like Swagger.

## Evaluation Criteria:
Clarity and structure of the code.

Effective use of RESTful principles and patterns. 
Implementation of secure authentication.
